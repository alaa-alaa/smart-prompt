A person is planning to start sale a medical equipment project that requires an initial investment of 200,000 dinars. The project is expected to generate equal annual cash flows of 52,000 dinars over the next 5 years. The discount rate for this project is 8%.
To help assess the financial feasibility of the project, the person wants to build a Web page application with a graphical user interface (GUI). This application will calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project to determine if it is a good investment.
Requirements:

Create a Python program with a GUI that allows the user to input the following parameters:

Initial investment amount (e.g., 200,000 dinars)
Annual cash flow (e.g., 52,000 dinars)
Discount rate (e.g., 8%)
Number of years (e.g., 5 years)
The GUI should have a button labeled "Calculate NPV." When clicked, the program should:

Calculate the NPV using the formula:
NPV=∑(cash flow/(1+discount rate)^t)−initial investment
 

Where:

cash flow = Annual cash flow amount
discount rate = Discount rate (in decimal form)
t = year (1, 2, 3, ... up to the number of years)
initial investment = Initial investment amount
Display the result (NPV value) on the GUI after the calculation.

Ensure the NPV result is rounded to two decimal places.
